;; cbor.core — definite-length CBOR (RFC 8949) encode/decode.
;;
;; Across a kotoba/IPLD codebase CBOR keeps getting hand-rolled — the CACAO leash
;; issuer, the apqc/kabuto/isco coordinators each open-code the major-type headers.
;; This is that once, with two encoders:
;;
;;   (encode x)          — canonical/deterministic: map keys sorted dag-cbor style
;;                         (shorter key first, then bytewise) → stable bytes for IPLD
;;   (encode-ordered ps) — a map from an ORDERED [k v] seq, keys emitted as given
;;                         (CAIP-122 CACAO and other insertion-order-sensitive wire
;;                         formats need this — canonical sorting would corrupt them)
;;
;;   (decode bytes)      — → Clojure data (maps as {}, arrays as [], text as String,
;;                         byte strings as bytes, ints as Long/number, bool/nil)
;;
;; Supported major types: 0 uint · 1 negint · 2 byte-string · 3 text · 4 array ·
;; 5 map · 6 tag (as an explicit `Tagged` wrapper — see below) · 7
;; (false/true/null). No indefinite lengths, no floats — a tight profile that
;; covers structured signing payloads and IPLD data.
;;
;;   (tagged 42 bytes)   — encodes as major type 6, tag `n`, then the wrapped
;;                         value; decodes back to a `Tagged`. Plain data never
;;                         silently becomes a tag and a tag never silently
;;                         becomes plain data — the wrapper is always explicit,
;;                         so canonical bytes stay unambiguous. IPLD's CID link
;;                         (tag 42) is layered on top by `kotoba-lang/ipld`;
;;                         this namespace stays codec-generic.
;;
;; PORTABLE (.cljc, real on both platforms — this used to be `.clj`-only despite
;; every downstream repo's docstring calling that out as a known gap). Byte
;; buffers are `java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream`/`ByteArrayInputStream` on :clj and
;; a plain growable JS array / an atom-backed cursor over a Uint8Array on :cljs;
;; `encode`/`decode`'s public contract (bytes in, bytes/Clojure-data out) is
;; unchanged on :clj and equivalent on :cljs (Uint8Array instead of byte-array,
;; JS string instead of java.lang.String — both are just "the platform's native
;; string/byte type").

;; An order-preserving map (vs. a Clojure map, which `encode` canonical-sorts).
;; Nestable: an OrderedMap value inside another OrderedMap keeps its own order —
;; what CAIP-122 CACAO needs (the {h,p,s} envelope AND p's 8 fields are ordered).
;;
;; `defrecord`, not `deftype`: a bare `deftype` with no protocol impl uses JVM
;; identity equality (two OrderedMaps with the same pairs are NOT `=`), and
;; adding one via `#?@(:clj [Object ...] :cljs [IEquiv ...])` (the shape
;; `Tagged` below used to need) doesn't even work on nbb -- SCI's `deftype`
;; support does not dispatch a custom implementation of a BUILT-IN cljs.core
;; protocol (`IEquiv`/`IHash`) on a deftype, `extend-type` included (confirmed
;; empirically: `Protocol not found: IEquiv` either way, in total isolation
;; from this file). `defrecord` sidesteps this entirely -- structural
;; equality/hash are part of what the compiler generates for a record on
;; EVERY platform (JVM/self-hosted cljs/nbb's SCI), not a protocol extension
;; nbb has to resolve at all. No existing caller relied on OrderedMap's old
;; identity-equality default (only `encode`/`decode` round-trip bytes are
;; ever asserted on), so this is a strict gain, not a behavior change.

;; keyword access, unlike `OrderedMap` above -- kept as narrow accessor fns so
;; a future caller never has to know or care that a record is a map under the
;; hood). Same `defrecord`-not-`deftype` reasoning as `OrderedMap`'s comment:
;; structural equality/hash come for free on every platform including nbb,
