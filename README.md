# dag-cbor-clj

[![CI](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/dag-cbor/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/dag-cbor/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

**Definite-length CBOR (RFC 8949) encode/decode — with both a canonical
(dag-cbor key-sorted) encoder and an order-preserving one for signing
payloads. No deps, babashka-friendly, and real `.cljc`: verified on both
the JVM and ClojureScript, byte-identically.**

CBOR keeps getting hand-rolled in kotoba/IPLD codebases (CACAO issuers, Pregel
coordinators each open-code the major-type headers). This is that once.

```clojure
(require '[cbor.core :as cbor])

(cbor/encode {"a" 1 "b" [2 3]})        ;=> bytes, map keys sorted dag-cbor style
(cbor/decode bytes)                     ;=> {"a" 1 "b" [2 3]}
(cbor/encode-ordered [["b" 1] ["a" 2]]) ;=> bytes, keys in the GIVEN order
```

- **`encode`** — deterministic: map keys sorted shorter-first-then-bytewise (dag-cbor),
  so the same data always yields the same bytes (content addressing, IPLD).
- **`encode-ordered`** — a map from an ordered `[k v]` seq, keys emitted as given.
  CAIP-122 CACAO and other insertion-order-sensitive wire formats need this;
  canonical sorting would corrupt the signature payload.
- **`decode`** — exactly one top-level value; maps → `{}`, arrays → `[]`,
  text → `String`, byte-strings → bytes (byte-array on JVM, `Uint8Array` on
  cljs), ints/finite float64 → numbers, true/false/null. Trailing bytes fail.

Supported major types: 0 uint · 1 negint · 2 byte-string · 3 text · 4 array ·
5 map · 6 explicit tags · 7 (false/true/null/finite float64). No indefinite
lengths. Floats always encode as IEEE-754 binary64; NaN and infinities are
rejected. `io-ipld` layers DAG-CBOR's tag-42-only and string-key rules on top.

## Portability

`cbor.core` used to be `cbor.core.clj` — JVM-only despite living in a
`.cljc`-named ecosystem. It is now genuinely portable: byte buffers are
`java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream`/`ByteArrayInputStream` on `:clj` and a plain
growable JS array / an atom-backed cursor over a `Uint8Array` on `:cljs`.

One correctness pitfall worth calling out because it's easy to reintroduce:
**big-endian multi-byte integers (the `uint32`/`uint64` header forms) must be
built with arithmetic (`+`/`*`/`quot`/`mod`), not `bit-and`/`bit-shift-*`.**
JavaScript's bitwise operators coerce their operand to Int32/Uint32 *before*
operating, so e.g. `(unsigned-bit-shift-right 4294967296 24)` silently
truncates `4294967296` (2^32) to `0` first — the bit pattern above 32 bits is
gone before the shift even happens. This is invisible on the JVM (`long` is
genuinely 64-bit) and only shows up as silently-wrong CBOR bytes for values
≥ 2^32 on `:cljs`. `byte-at` (encode) and `read-n` (decode) use
division/mod and `+`/`*` specifically to stay correct up to
`Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` (2^53) on both platforms.

## Correctness

```bash
clojure -M:test                    # JVM — 13 tests / 75 assertions
npm install && npm run test:cljs   # real ClojureScript, via shadow-cljs node-test
```

The `bb test` alternative that used to be noted here is **unavailable**:
babashka was retired as this workspace's script host (ADR-2607173000) and the
conversion left `scripts/tasks.edn` empty, so it has had no runnable path since
2026-07-17 (ADR-2608131600). `clojure -M:test` is unaffected.

```
Ran 7 tests containing 55 assertions.
0 failures, 0 errors.
```

on both platforms — including RFC 8949 Appendix-A vectors, canonical
key-ordering, order preservation, byte-string round-trips, and the
`uint32`/`uint64` boundary values (`0xffffffff`, `0x100000000`) that the
JS-bitwise-truncation pitfall above would otherwise silently corrupt.

Verification note: an initial ClojureScript check via `nbb` (a fast
SCI-based cljs interpreter, good for quick smoke tests) reported a false
failure on the nested-`OrderedMap` case — nbb's `deftype` support doesn't
implement direct `.-field` access, which this namespace's `OrderedMap`
uses. That is an `nbb` interpreter limitation, not a bug here: the CI job
above compiles with real `shadow-cljs` (the same toolchain `net-kotobase`/
`app-aozora` deploy with) and passes all 7 tests with 0 failures. Lesson
kept here on purpose: a fast interpreter is a good first pass, not a
substitute for compiling with the real target toolchain before trusting a
"portable" claim.
